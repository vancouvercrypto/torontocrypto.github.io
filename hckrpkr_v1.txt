hckrpkr:
----

Hackerpoker('hckrpkr') is a game to be utilized amongst hacker
collectives to build community, communications, fortify internal OPSEC
and increase knowledge of common social engineering techniques. For
2016, the current popular style of Poker play is Texas Hold'Em.
Observe the game rules here for future reference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em

A framework of rules is provided to help assist in bootstrapping
further hckrpkr games. They are by no means mandatory, however,
caution must be exercised while modifying/adding rules that may
potentially break the atmosphere of the game. The purpose of these
rules are to increase the use and countering of common HUMANINT
('Human Intelligence') procedures utilized by potentially Negative
Operators ('NO') who may pose a threat to the hacker collective. These
NO's could include: intelligence agencies, rogue hackers, corporate
espionage, hostile law enforcement and more (this is not an exhaustive
list).

Remember: The general rule of OPSEC is silence is security. Gossip and
loosed-lip personnel are easy prey for social engineering and
intelligence gathering on organisations. By negating leaks of
information, this has the beneficial effect of minimizing impact of
games being infiltrated, disrupted or damaged from compromising
hckrpkr locations. If you think someone is too self-compromising for
the game, politely request their denial of admission (or vote on it
for you democractic types).

These rules are to be observed and administered via the game host
('host') before, during and after the game.
