A good portion of my last week was figuring out
how to best deliver TorontoCrypto's content. Thankfully, having finally
sat down and spent some time with [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS),
we now have two streams of content to add to your RSS stream or reader. If
you are new to the idea of streamlining media, check
out this article on [RSS and how to amalgamate your news](http://webtrends.about.com/od/revie2/tp/Rss-Aggregator-Tools-Combine-Rss-Feeds.htm).

We've also added the [CCLA](http://ccla.org/), [OpenMedia](https://openmedia.ca/)
and [Hacklab](https://hacklab.to/) streams
to our Twitter as we respect these organizations immensely.

Bill C-51 pending, this Summer already has plenty of great things in store
for privacy in Toronto!
