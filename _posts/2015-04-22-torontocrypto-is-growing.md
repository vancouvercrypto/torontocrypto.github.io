What a start to the year already! Some of us are barely able to rest between
setting up new [CryptoParty stations for Digifest](/blog/2015/03/21/cryptoparty-at-digifest.html), [planning the I2P Comes To
Toronto event](/blog/2014/12/27/i2p-meetup-and-cta.html) and [establishing an IRC i2p relay bot](https://github.com/torontocrypto/borgil).
For the forseeable future, I can confidently say that Toronto Crypto's presence in both the infosec and
political realm will be increasing. We can't do it alone! We need your help to
grow this organization in to the political advocacy that Toronto (and Canada) needs!

We are looking for enthusiastic talent from all realms of society and political
spectrums! You don't have to be a hacker, programmer, designer or activist to
get involved with us. [Email us](mailto:info@torontocrypto.org?Subject=I'm interested in helping!) and let us know how we can get you working with us. The surveillance state will not slow down and it's our job to keep up with
the pace. Get involved.
