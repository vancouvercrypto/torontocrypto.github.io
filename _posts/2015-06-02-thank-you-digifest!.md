This last month we participated in a hosting a CryptoParty
at Digifest's start-up market. We had a blast presenting our work stations for
mobile security, [Tor](https://torproject.org), file encryption, [I2P](https://geti2p.net) and PGP email encryption.
The turn out was phenomenal and we couldn't be happier with the input we received from all
attendees! Events like these are important to us, as it assists us all in noticing that there has been a considerable difference in the last few years on the public's awareness of the importance or privacy and security in their daily lives. Thank you to the [Digifest](http://torontodigifest.ca/2015/) organization, as well as all the start-up's that we got to meet on that day.

If your organization is interested in having us host a [CryptoParty](https://torontocrypto.org/CryptoParty), please do not hesitate
to get in touch with us.
