hckrpkr:
----

Hackerpoker('hckrpkr') is a game to be
utilized amongst hacker collectives to
build community, communications,
fortify internal OPSEC and increase knowledge
of common social engineering techniques. For
2016, the current popular style of Poker
play is Texas Hold'Em. [Observe the game
rules here for future reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em).

A framework of rules is provided to help
assist in bootstrapping further hckrpkr games.
They are by no means mandatory, however, caution
must be exercised while modifying/adding rules
that may potentially break the atmosphere of the
game. The purpose of these rules are to increase
the use and countering of common HUMANINT ('Human Intelligence')
procedures utilized by potentially Negative Operators ('NO')
who may pose a threat to the hacker collective. These
NO's could include: intelligence agencies, rogue hackers,
corporate espionage, hostile law enforcement and more (this
is an exhaustive list).

Remember: The general rule of OPSEC is silence is security. Gossip
and loosed-lip personnel are easy prey for social engineering
and intelligence gathering on organisations. By negating leaks
of information, this has the beneficial effect of minimizing impact
of games being infiltrated, disrupted or damaged from compromising
hckrpkr locations. If you think someone is too self-compromising
for the game, politely request their denial of admission (or vote
on it for you democractic types).

These rules are to be observed and administered
via the game host ('host') before, during and
after the game.
